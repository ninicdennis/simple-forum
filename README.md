## Simple Forum

This is a simplistic forum created in react as a final project for Helio. I will be using react as the front end,
and using Hapi + knex for the API/Backend. 

To run:

chmod +x the 3 following files: startapi, startbackend , and generate-data.

Proceed to run in the following order:

./startapi

./startbackend

./generate-data


## Notes

Front end is located at http://locaslhost:3000

API is located at http://localhost:5251

Backend is run through a docker container using postgres.
