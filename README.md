## Simple Forum

This is a simplistic forum created in react as a final project for Helio. I will be using react as the front end,
and using Hapi + knex for the API/Backend. 

To run:

for time sake, I haven't set up a docker file to run it all at once, so you just have to run the api and front end
seperately. This can be done with NPM.

##Notes

Front end is located at http://locaslhost:3000

API is located at http://localhost:5251

Backend is run through a docker container using postgres.
